    "\"Looks like the Chief's not here. Next!\" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the Ceres monitoring station!\n",
    "\n",
    "As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her word search (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: XMAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of XMAS - you need to find all of them. Here are a few ways XMAS might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with `.:`\n",

    "```\n",
    "In this word search, XMAS occurs a total of 18 times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any XMAS have been replaced with `.:`\n",

    "The naive solution would be to find every X in the input and simply check all (up to) 9 adjacent spaces. For instance, with the example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MMMSXXMASM\n",

    "MAMMMXMMMM\n",
    "MXMXAXMASX\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We would stop at `(0, 4)` and look for an M at `[(0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]`, which we would find at `[(1, 3), (1, 5)]`. We would then search for an A at each of those, and finally an S at any subsequent matches. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the big issues with this solution is keeping track of the bounds. For instance, an X in row 3 (index 2) couldn't possibly spell \"XMAS\" because there are only 2 rows above it. "
